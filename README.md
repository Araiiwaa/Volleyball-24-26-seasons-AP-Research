RQ: To what extent do coaches' and athletes’ insights regarding timeouts align with each other, and how do those decisions affect the likelihood of gaining a sideout?

Sub question #1: Does calling timeouts improve the likelihood of gaining a sideout as the opponent's run increases?
Null hypothesis: Calling a timeout has no effect on the likelihood of gaining a sideout across all run lengths.
Alternative hypothesis: Calling a timeout increases the likelihood of gaining a sideout across run lengths.

Sub question #2: Does the effectiveness of a timeout depend on the type of points during the opponent runs (erroors vs earned points)?	
Null hypothesis: The type of points in the run (error vs earned) does not modify the effect of a timeout on sideout likelihood.
Alternative hypothesis: The type of points in the run (error vs earned) modifies timeout effectiveness (sideout likelihood differs depending on RunCause).
